# DreamLayer AI Contribution: Luma Text-to-Image Node Integration

## Description
Successfully integrated Luma AI API into DreamLayer, providing direct API calls to Luma's text-to-image generation service. This integration adds support for multiple Luma models including Photon 1, Photon Flash 1, Ray 2, Ray Flash 2, and Ray 1.6.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Key Injector Updates
**File:** `dream_layer_backend_utils/api_key_injector.py`
**Changes:**
- Mapped Luma AI nodes to `LUMA_API_KEY` instead of generic API keys
- Updated environment variable mapping to use `luma_api_key`
- Added proper node class name mappings for all Luma node types

### 2. Model Configuration Updates
**File:** `dream_layer_backend/dream_layer.py`
**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive Luma model mappings in `API_KEY_TO_MODELS`
- Included all Luma models: photon-1, photon-flash-1, ray-2, ray-flash-2, ray-1-6
- Updated model display names for better user experience

### 3. Luma AI Node Implementation
**File:** `ComfyUI/comfy_api_nodes/nodes_luma.py`
**Changes:**
- Implemented direct HTTP requests to Luma AI API endpoints
- Added support for multiple Luma models with proper parameter handling
- Implemented proper JSON structure for text prompts and image generation
- Added comprehensive error handling for HTTP status codes (401, 402, 403, 409, 429)
- Updated hidden input from generic API keys to `luma_api_key`

### 4. Workflow Integration
**Files:** `txt2img_workflow.py`, `img2img_workflow.py`
**Changes:**
- Added missing `all_api_keys` parameter to `inject_api_keys_into_workflow()` calls
- Imported `read_api_keys_from_env` function
- Fixed function signature mismatches for proper API key injection

### 5. Error Handling Improvements
**File:** `ComfyUI/comfy_api_nodes/apis/client.py`
**Changes:**
- Added specific error handling for HTTP 403 Forbidden status code
- Enhanced user-friendly error messages for authentication issues
- Improved debug logging for API request tracking

### 6. CUDA Compatibility Fixes
**File:** `ComfyUI/comfy/model_management.py`
**Changes:**
- Added automatic fallback to CPU mode when CUDA is not available
- Improved device detection logic for better compatibility
- Enhanced logging for device selection process

## Key Technical Improvements

- **Direct API Integration**: Bypasses ComfyUI proxy for direct calls to Luma AI endpoints
- **Multi-Model Support**: Supports all major Luma models (Photon, Ray series)
- **Simplified Authentication**: Only requires `LUMA_API_KEY` in `.env` file
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Handles all common HTTP error codes with user-friendly messages
- **CPU Mode Compatibility**: Automatic fallback for systems without CUDA support
