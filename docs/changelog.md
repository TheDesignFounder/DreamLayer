The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Mask Upload Feature** - Added mask upload option in Inpaint toolbar with file validation (PNG ‚â§ 10 MB), 128px thumbnail preview, and multipart payload support
- **Backend Integration** - Integrated mask upload with existing ComfyUI workflow system in `img2img_server.py`
- **Actual Image Generation** - Mask upload now generates real images using ComfyUI instead of placeholder responses
- **Multipart Form Support** - Added support for multipart form data with file uploads in img2img server
- Comprehensive documentation system
- MkDocs integration for GitHub Pages
- API reference documentation
- Architecture diagrams with Mermaid
- Contributing guidelines

### Changed

- **Moved img2img endpoint** from `dream_layer.py` to `img2img_server.py` for better ComfyUI integration
- **Updated frontend** to use port 5004 for img2img requests
- **Enhanced workflow system** to support mask injection for inpainting
- Improved project structure
- Enhanced code organization

### Fixed

- **Image Generation** - Fixed placeholder response issue by implementing actual ComfyUI workflow integration
- **Server Architecture** - Properly separated concerns between different server components

### [Unreleased]

#### Added

- Integrated img2img mask upload with ComfyUI workflow system, supporting both regular img2img and inpainting workflows.
- Added file validation for mask uploads (PNG, ‚â§10MB) and 128px thumbnail preview in the UI.
- Unit tests for mask upload and preview using React Testing Library.
- Usage documentation and format notes for mask upload (white=keep, black=inpaint).

#### Changed

- Refactored backend to move img2img endpoints to `img2img_server.py` for proper ComfyUI integration.
- Reduced default steps and batch size for CPU compatibility (as low as 3 steps, 256x256, batch size 1).
- Increased backend timeout for slow CPU image generation (recommend 15+ minutes for some CPUs).
- Updated frontend to allow model selection and to use the correct img2img server port.

#### Fixed

- Patched ComfyUI model loader to avoid PyTorch `weights_only` errors by setting `weights_only=False` in `utils.py`.
- Installed and switched to a safetensors model (`v1-5-pruned-emaonly.safetensors`) for better compatibility and reliability.
- Documented troubleshooting steps for model loading, including:
  - PyTorch/ComfyUI safe loading issues
  - Model file format and placement
  - Environment variable and dependency setup
- Added detailed logging for workflow generation and file handling.

#### Troubleshooting & Local Setup Notes

- Faced repeated issues with PyTorch model loading (`weights_only` error) and resolved by patching ComfyUI and switching to a safetensors model.
- Installed missing dependencies (e.g., `lpips`) for custom nodes.
- Observed that on CPU-only machines, image generation is extremely slow (even with minimal settings), and may not complete before timeout.
- Used ComfyUI web UI to monitor workflow queue and confirm that jobs are running, but output images may take several minutes or longer to appear.
- Documented all steps and provided guidance for other contributors facing similar local setup issues.

#### Known Issues

- Image generation on CPU is extremely slow (even with minimal settings).
- On some machines, generation may not complete before timeout.
- Unable to attach working screenshots in PR due to local hardware limitations, but workflow and logs confirm end-to-end integration.
